## Overview

This class examines the role of data within one of the defining topics in U.S. history: slavery. It offers a lens into how the system of chattel slavery in the United States rested on a foundation of data, and how enslavers constructed, recorded, and used data.

## Agenda

- Discussion: Daina Ramey Berry, *The Price for Their Pound of Flesh* (15 min.)
- Activity: The Transatlantic Slave Trade Database (20 min.)
- Tutorial: Exploring Tabular Data (25 min.)
- Debrief (15 min.)

## Readings

- Daina Ramey Berry, *The Price for Their Pound of Flesh: The Value of the Enslaved, from Womb to Grave* (2016), pp. 1-9, 33-57.
    - Alternative reading: "Episode 176: Daina Ramey Berry, The Value of the Enslaved from Womb to Grave", *Ben Franklin's World Podcast* (March 6, 2018). 

## Lesson Plan

### Discussion: Berry, *The Price for Their Pound of Flesh*

**Accordingly to Berry, what were different types of value that enslaved people assigned to themselves and were assigned to them?**

**What kind of narrative choices does Berry make in this book in attempting to balance stories and narratives vs. numbers and statistics? What does the data *add* to her interpretation?**

> Berry's categories of value:

> 1. Spirit or soul value. The self-worth of enslaved people
> 2. Appraisal value. Projected values by planters, doctors, traders, etc. for “potential work output.”
> 3. Market value. Sale price for their human flesh - “often marked the highest price paid for them as commodities”
> 4. Ghost value. Price tag affixed to deceased enslaved bodies through the “domestic cadaver trade”

### Activity: The Transatlantic Slave Trade Database

>*There are three goals of this assignment. First, it will help students practice the skills of data ethnography they will use in their [Data Biography](module-2/data-biography) assignment. Second, it will allow them to start working with a tabular dataset related to the topic for today (slavery). Third, it will help them understand the tensions between using data to study and understand the history of 
enslavement vs. the danger of quantifying human beings.*

Today we're going to look at The Transatlantic Slave Trade Database, a watershed digital project focused on the history of slavery:  <https://slavevoyages.org/>. You're going to practice the same approach you'll be taking when you complete your [Data Biography](module-2/data-biography) of a separate dataset. 

In small groups, go to <https://slavevoyages.org/> and collectively try to write answers to the following questions about the dataset in a shared Google Doc: 

- **What** kind of information is contained in this database?
- **Where** did the data come from? 
- **Who** collected, processed, and made it available?
- **How** was it collected, processed, and made available?
- **Why** was it collected, processed, and made available?
- **How** is the data stored today? 

<br>**Debrief Discussion**: 
- Which questions were the easiest vs. most difficul to answer?
- If you were going to give feedback to the project team about its website and documentation, what would you say?

>*Go through different parts of the [About page](https://www.slavevoyages.org/about/) for the site. Emphasize that this is the primary place you will often go for data projects to answer some of the above questions.*


### Tutorial: Exploring Tabular Data

Tabular data is the storage of information through a system of rows and columns. Arguably the most common format you will come across tabular data is through a spreadsheet. Although spreadsheets can come in several different file types, for today we're going to work in Google Sheets. 

Watch the first  video provides a nice introduction to Google Sheets:

Click [Go to a subset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CUrZM06ZRBajyx2gRJN1IkRfZYx7cUgl2fkteNqpvpU/edit?usp=sharing) then make a copy of the Google Sheet by going to `File -> Make a copy` and use that copy for the rest of the tutorial.

**Sorting** a spreadsheet is a common task. This allows you to "read" a spreadsheet more easily by ordering all the rows by different criteria (typically either alphabetically or numerically - ie. smallest to largest). [Instructions on how to sort a Google Sheet](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3540681?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop#:~:text=Sort%20data%20in%20alphabetical%20or%20numerical%20order).

- Sort the spreadsheet in **descending order by the `Total embarked` column**. This is arranging the ships in your spreadsheet by the number of enslaved people a ship began with (embarked) at the start of its voyage.
    - What was the name of the ship that had the largest recorded number of captives when it began (embarked) on its voyage? ```Ocilla```
    - How many captives did that ship carry when it embarked on its voyage? ```1500 captives```
    - What country's flag did it sail under? ```U.S.A```

>Question to put some of these numbers in context: Look around. How many students are in this classroom? If each classroom in this building had roughly the same number of students, how many classes would you need to combine to equal the total number of captives that were forced onto this single ship?

- Try sorting the spreadsheet so that you can answer the following questions: What year was the  **earliest** and **latest** recorded arrival of a transatlantic slave trade voyage in this database? ```1514``` and ```1866```
- Sort the spreadhseet by `Voyage ID` so that it is back in its original order.

**Filtering** a spreadsheet allows you to only look at one particular part of the spreadsheet while "hiding" the rest of the data. This can be helpful if your dataset is quite long.

- Filter the `
- You can also combine multiple categories into one filter. Filter the spreadsheet so that you are **only** looking at ships that flew the country flags: `U.S.A` and `Great Britain`. 
    
### Debrief

- Based on your exploration of the database and some of the contents of the data, what  
- 
- limitations can you think of when it comes to using this dataset?
- Watch the following video of an animated data visualization using the Transatlantic Slave Trade Database and consider some of the following questions:
    - What are the strengths of this visualization for studying and understanding the Transatlantic Slave Trade?
    - What are some risks or downsides of this kind of data visualization? Does it reduce human beings into nameless dots?
