## Overview

This class examines the role of data within one of the defining topics in U.S. history: slavery. It offers a lens into how the system of chattel slavery in the United States rested on a foundation of data, and how enslavers constructed, recorded, and used data.

## Agenda

- Discussion: Daina Ramey Berry, *The Price for Their Pound of Flesh*
- Activity: The Transatlantic Slave Trade Database
- Tutorial: Exploring Tabular Data (common file formats, structuring, filtering, sorting).

## Readings:

## Lesson Plan

### Discussion: Berry, *The Price for Their Pound of Flesh*

**Accordingly to Berry, what were different types of value that enslaved people assigned to themselves and were assigned to them?**

>  1. Spirit or soul value. The self-worth of enslaved people
> 2. Appraisal value. Projected values by planters, doctors, traders, etc. for “potential work output.”
> 3. Market value. Sale price for their human flesh - “often marked the highest price paid for them as commodities”
> 4. Ghost value. Price tag affixed to deceased enslaved bodies through the “domestic cadaver trade”

**What kind of narrative choices does Berry make in this book in attempting to balance stories and narratives vs. numbers and statistics? What does the data *add* to her interpretation?**

### Activity: The Transatlantic Slave Trade Database 

>There are three goals of this assignment. First, it will help students practice the skills of data ethnography they will use in their [Data Biography](module-2/data-biography) assignment. Second, it will allow them to start working with a tabular dataset related to the topic for today (slavery). Third, it will help them understand the tensions between using data to study and better understand the history of 
enslaved people vs. the danger of quantifying human beings.

**Step 1: A Truncated Data Biography**

Today we're going to look at The Transatlantic Slave Trade Database, a watershed digital project focused on the history of slavery:  <https://slavevoyages.org/>. You're going to practice the same approach you'll be taking when you complete your [Data Biography](module-2/data-biography) of a separate dataset. In small groups, go to <https://slavevoyages.org/> and try to write answers to the following questions about the dataset:

- **What** kind of information is contained in this database?
- **Where** did the data come from? 
- **Who** collected, processed, and made it available?
- **How** was it collected, processed, and made available?
- **Why** was it collected, processed, and made available?
- **How** is it stored today? How did you access it?

**Debrief**

- Reflect on the process of using the database interface to try to find answers to these questions. What worked? What didn't?
- What challenges did you run into when using it?
- What limitations can you think of when it comes to using this dataset?
- Watch the following video of an animated data visualization using the Transatlantic Slave Trade Database and consider some of the following questions:
    - What are the strengths of this visualization for studying and understanding the Transatlantic Slave Trade?
    - What are some risks or downsides of this kind of data visualization? Does it reduce human beings into nameless dots?

### Tutorial: Exploring Tabular Data 

Tabular data is the storage of information through a system of rows and columns. Arguably the most common format you will come across tabular data is through a spreadsheet. Although spreadsheets can come in several different file types, for today we're going to work in Google Sheets. Click [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CUrZM06ZRBajyx2gRJN1IkRfZYx7cUgl2fkteNqpvpU/edit?usp=sharing) then make a copy of the Google Sheet by going to `File -> Make a copy` and use that copy for the following tutorial.

**Sorting** a spreadsheet is a common task. This allows you to "read" a spreadsheet more easily by ordering all the rows by different criteria (ex. alphabetically, from smallest to largest, etc.).

- Sort the spreadsheet in **descending order by the `Total embarked` column**. This is arranging the ships in your spreadsheet by the number of enslaved people a ship began with (embarked) at the start of its voyage.
    - What was the name of the ship that had the largest recorded number of captives when it began (embarked) on its voyage? ```Ocilla```
    - How many captives did that ship carry when it embarked on its voyage? ```1500 captives```
    - What country's flag did it sail under? ```U.S.A```

```Question to put some of these numbers in context: Look around. How many students are in this classroom? If each classroom in this building had roughly the same number of students, how many classrooms would you need to equal the total number of captives that were forced onto this single ship?``` 


**Filtering** a spreadsheet allows you to only look at one particular part of the spreadsheet while "hiding" the rest of the data. This can be helpful if your dataset is quite long.

- Filter the spreadsheet so that you are **only** looking at games that fall under the `Genre` category of `Sports`. 
	- How many games are there for this category?
	- Once you are done, reset the filter by clicking `Select All`
- You can also combine multiple categories into one filter. Filter the `Platform` column so that you are **only** looking at the following kinds of Playstation games: `PS`, `PS2`, `PS3`, `PS4`
	- How many games are there for this combined category?
	- Once you have finished so that you are seeing all the data
	- Once you are done, reset the filter by clicking `Select All`

Spend some time exploring the database itself using the online data portal (<https://slavevoyages.org/voyage/database>). See if you can figure out answers to the following questions using the `Data Visualization` tab:

- Which nation sailed the most voyages in the 18th century?
> Great Britain
- In which year did the largest number of enslaved people arrive in Barbados? 
>
- In what sub-region in Africa were the most enslaved people purchased?
