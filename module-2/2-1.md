## Activity: HOLC Redlining Maps

>In this activity, students use an interactive map interface to explore a particular city (use the nearest city they might be familiar with, if any). This map interface, *Mapping Inequality*, has scanned, georeferenced, and overlaid HOLC maps from the 1930s onto modern cities (maps which were referenced in the *Data Feminism* reading for this module. This allows students to zoom into different nieighborhood and explore how this federal agency overlaid conceptions of race, class, and ethnicity onto their grading system for mortgage lending.

You read a bit about the mortgage risk maps created by ==the Homeowner’s Loan Corporation (HOLC)=={Q3139614} during the 1930s. In this activity you're going to explore one of these maps. Here is some background to get you started:

**Instructions:**
1.  Open this [1938 interactive map of Denver](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=11/39.71/-105.117&city=denver-co ) produced by the ==Homeowner’s Loan Corporation (HOLC)=={Q3139614}
2.  Spend a few minutes familiarizing yourself with the site and its interface. Try to get a handle on what kind of information is there and how to navigate the site. Bonus: try to find your school, home, church, favorite restaurant, etc.
3.  Locate the four areas assigned to your group by zooming and “panning” around the map. 

- Group A: A3, A4, A5, B5
- Group B: B10, C16, D7, D8
- Group C: D6, D12, D13, D15
- Group D: C19, D7, D10, D14

4.  Click on each of the areas assigned to your group and read the accompanying notes that the mapmaker recorded for that area. Focus on the following text: **1. Area Characteristics**, **2. Inhabitants** , **5. Clarifying Remarks**.

- What’s there today? *Note: If you click Map Options -> Polygons you can see the current map of Denver underneath.*
- Were they generally low or high risk? 
- What factors contributed to that grade?
