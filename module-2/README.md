1.  Open this [1938 interactive map of Denver](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=11/39.71/-105.117&city=denver-co ) produced by the ==Homeowner’s Loan Corporation (HOLC)=={Q3139614}
2.  Spend a few minutes familiarizing yourself with the site and its interface. Try to get a handle on what kind of information is there and how to navigate the site. Bonus: try to find your school, home, church, favorite restaurant, etc.
3.  Locate the four areas assigned to your group by zooming and “panning” around the map. 

- Group A: A3, A4, A5, B5
- Group B: B10, C16, D7, D8
- Group C: D6, D12, D13, D15
- Group D: C19, D7, D10, D14

4.  Click on each of the areas assigned to your group and read the accompanying notes that the mapmaker recorded for that area. Focus on the following text: **1. Area Characteristics**, **2. Inhabitants** , **5. Clarifying Remarks**.

- What’s there today? *Note: If you click Map Options -> Polygons you can see the current map of Denver underneath.*
- Were they generally low or high risk? 
- What factors contributed to that grade?
