# Module 2: Historicizing Data

## Module Overview {#overview}

This module teaches students about the historical dimensions of data: both the historical process and context within which datasets are produced, and how data has been used and misused at different points in history.

## Learning Outcomes {#outcomes}

Through this module, students will be able to:

- Approach data as a historical artifact and object of analysis
- Understand how data was collected, used, and misused within different historical contexts
- Analyze the origins and contexts of particular datasets: who, what, when, where, why, and how they were created
- Work with tabular data and spreadsheets

## Key Concepts {#concepts}

Through this module, students will be able to define and consider the following concepts:

**Data as Archive**
> Students will learn to approach data as historical artificats. Rather than seeing data as purely a source of quantitative information, this module approaches data as archival documents with their own cultural, political, and social histories.

**Data Biography**
> All datasets are actively created. Rather than seeing data as objective reflections of the world, this module teaches students how to analyze the creators and contexts of datasets: the historical who, when, where, how, and why of a dataset's creation.

**Tabular Data**
> Tabular data, often stored as spreadsheets, is one of the most common data formats students will encounter. This module teaches how tabular data is formated and some basic skills in how to explore tabular data.

## Schedule: {#schedule}

>```We might think about different URL / subfolder conventions. Ex. /historicizing-data/ is the main folder and overview page for the module, then we could have /historicizing-data/day-1/ as the URL to lesson plan for Day 2.1

#### [Day 2.1: Data Histories](/module-2/2-1/)
#### [Day 2.2: Slavery and Data](/module-2/2-2/)
#### [Day 2.3: The US Census](/module-2/2-3/)
#### [Day 2.4: Working with Census Data](/module-2/2-4/)

>```Option: example of how we could divide a section into different tabs within single Juncture essay```
